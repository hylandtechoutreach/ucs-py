# Input/Output
The main focus of this lesson is input & output in Python. It also covers the general idea of libraries without too much specificity.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Understand how libraries enable developers to leverage existing code
- Call functions from libraries
- Retrieve console input from the user with `input`
- Print things to the console with `print` and other library functions

## Lesson Outline
The lesson consists of these parts:

### Warm-Up: Zodiac Compatibility
This warm-up revolves around the [Zodiac Compatibility Checker](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/ZodiacCompatibility?embed=true) program.

#### Part One: Preparation
First, make sure the database is cleared by running the compatibility checker, and entering `DEL ALL` as the command. This will remove any old entries from the system.

Then, provide a brief introduction to the [Zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology#The_zodiac) in case students are not familiar with the concept. In essence:

>The zodiac is a celestial belt divided into 12 equal parts, each associated with specific constellations and corresponding astrological signs, used to interpret personality traits and predict events based on the position of celestial bodies at one's birth.

#### Part Two: Entering Information
Students should visit the compatibility checker (linked from the [lesson homepage](StudentDesc.md)) and enter their name and birth date. Show students how to do it by entering some personal information. They should make sure to enter their information accurately.

#### Part Three: Displaying Compatibility
Once all students have entered their information, run the program again. Be sure to zoom in, and open up full-screen mode. Instead of entering a name, enter `LIST ALL` - this command will cycle through each name in the database, and display the compatibility with other names. Hopefully, students will enjoy seeing who their friends and enemies should be based solely on dates of birth.

### Lecture: Libraries & Input/Output
Present the [Libraries & IO PowerPoint](LibrariesIO.pptx).

### Code-Along: Divination
Walk through the [code-along instructions](CodeAlongDivination.md) with the students to make some updates to a console-based astrology application.

### Formative Assessment: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6525ab1d9e4a12863768122a).
