# Input/Output
The main focus of this lesson is input & output in Python. It also covers the general idea of libraries without too much specificity.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Understand how libraries enable developers to leverage existing code
- Call functions from libraries
- Retrieve console input from the user with `input`
- Print things to the console with `print` and other library functions

## Lesson Outline
The lesson consists of these parts:

### Warm-Up: Do Now
Have students fill out a [review form](https://forms.office.com/r/vPuB3qPpxT). [View responses here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPage.aspx?fragment=FormId%3DiNuljKul90il4EzlCTX4B33juYEmlJlJpIkctSGCv9RUQUNBRVNCOElPSEdKUzg1RDFJNUxGMDBDRC4u%26Token%3D4c1cb9335ac7469b8ada1c0c4bcabb00).

### Lecture: Libraries & Input/Output
Present the [Libraries & IO PowerPoint](LibrariesIO.pptx).

### Code-Along: Divination
Walk through the [code-along instructions](CodeAlongDivination.md) with the students to make some updates to a console-based astrology application.

### Formative Assessment: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6525ab1d9e4a12863768122a).
