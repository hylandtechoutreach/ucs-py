# Command Line
This lesson introduces the command line/bash as a general idea. The students should gain some familiarity with the tool, and feel comfortable at least moving around directories. They should understand some basics about how commands work.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Understand how the command line fits into the history of computers
- Interact with basic console applications
- Build output-only console applications in Python

## Lesson Outline
The lesson consists of these parts:

### Warm-Up: Magical Python Story
Students should follow [the instructions](WarmUpStory.md) and write a story about a magical python. This is not a coding warm-up - the focus is on typing out a story. The text will be used for the code-along activity later in the lesson.

### Lecture
The [lecture](CommandLine.pptx) introduces the idea of the command line, and gets into a few of the most basic commands:

- `pwd`
- `ls`
- `cd`

#### Replit Demo
As part of the lecture, show the commands in action. One of the simplest ways to do this is using the built-in Replit shell - it surfaces a terminal for a small virtual machine. There is a link to [this Repl project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/ShellCommands) in the slides. There are also slide notes that contain instructions:

1. Click on the "Replit Shell" link: `https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/ShellCommands`
1. Fork the project
1. Open the Shell (under **Tools** -> **Shell** button)
1. Try out some basic commands: `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`
1. Show how to use **TAB**, **UP**, and **Ctrl**+**C**
    1. An example for **Ctrl**+**C** could be running the `cmatrix` command and stopping it

### Code-Along: Story Script
Follow the [instructions](CodeAlongStoryScript.md) to create a Python script that tells the story from the warm-up activity. The script should be made entirely from `print` and `time.sleep` statements.

### Self-Paced Work: Terminus
Instruct students to try the [Terminus game](http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/). The game reinforces basic command line concepts, and should increase their overall comfort level with the command line. This is strictly meant to be fun.
