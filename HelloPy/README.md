# Hello Python
This lesson serves as the introduction for the entire program. It presents Python as a programming language, and provides students with an opportunity to learn some of the basic syntax.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Name some common use cases for Python
- Understand how a computer (or Python) reads and executes scripts
- Recognize basic Python syntax

## Warm-Up: Introductions & Icebreaker
Since this is the first session of the program, kick things off with instructor introductions, student introductions, and an icebreaker activity. The icebreaker can be a game, like Drawasaurus, Gartic Phone, or Friendivia.

## Lecture: Hello Python
Present the [Hello Python PowerPoint](HelloPython.pptx). There are notes in the slides.

## Self-Paced Work: CodeCombat
Students will visit the [CodeCombat site](https://codecombat.com/play/dungeon) and play through a bit of the game. Walk through the first couple of lessons as a group to ensure that each student knows how to proceed. The site should be fairly intuitive to use - there are arrows that show where to click and what to type. Students are welcome to go as far as they can through the dungeon.

Make sure to emphasize the importance of reading through the instructions.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/64fa2ecd063280fc4c2b25c7).
