# Conditionals
This lesson is all about conditional statements in Python. These statements allow program flow to change based on true or false values.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Recognize the boolean data type
- Use `if` statements to control program flow

## Lesson Outline
The lesson consists of these parts:

### Warm-Up: Chatbot
Show students the [chatbot](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs-py/Assets/Chatbot.html) linked from the lesson homepage, and let them talk to it a bit. Note that it is possible to turn the bot into a cat.

### Lecture: Conditional Statements
Present the [Conditionals PowerPoint](Conditionals.pptx). There is also a mini quiz within the slides.

### Code-Along: Chatbot
Walk through the [code-along instructions](CodeAlongChatbot.md) with the students to build a simple chatbot that can respond to a few messages.

### Survey
Have the students complete the survey linked on the lesson homepage. View responses [here](https://hylandsw-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/joseph_maxwell_hyland_com/EeUPn-X2ELhLiGPi7qu7XKEBgpqq8qr6KxG5tyqxxPuXKg?e=FNuRhH).
