# Hyland Python Academy @ UCS
This repository contains material for Hyland's Python Academy course at Urban Community School.

## Overview
In this course, students will learn some basic programming concepts through an introduction to the Python programming language. They will not need any prior experience to participate in this academy, but the material will be more rigorous than the HTML/CSS content. Students will be expected to focus, learn, and retain knowledge.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Explain the use cases, history, and power of Python
- Interact with the user through **input** and **output**
- Store, change, and access data using **variables**
- Dictate program flow with **conditionals**
- Understand the breadth of python possibilities
