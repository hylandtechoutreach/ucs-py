# Functions
This lesson is all about functions in Python. These allow code to be encapsulated and reused on-demand.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Recognize function definitions and function calls
- Define functions
- Call functions

## Resources
Be sure to print out copies of the [Functions Worksheet](FunctionsWorksheet.docx) before class.

## Lesson Outline
The lesson consists of these parts:

### Warm-Up: Smart Home Custom Routines
Start by showing [this video that shows how to create a Custom Routine with Amazon Alexa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5spW9gHgm8). Then, hand out copies of the [Functions Worksheet](FunctionsWorksheet.docx) and instruct the students to answer the **Warm-Up** question. This leads into the lecture, where custom routines are used as an analogy to explain how functions work in programming.

### Lecture: Functions
Present the [Functions PowerPoint](Functions.pptx).

### Practice: Worksheet
Hand out the [Functions Worksheet](FunctionsWorksheet.docx), and have students complete all the numbered questions to the best of their ability. They should hold onto the worksheets after they finish.

If no physical copies are available, students should be able to access the worksheet through the [embedded page](FunctionsWorksheet.md) on the GitBook.

### Code-Along: Sky Drawing
Walk through the [code-along instructions](CodeAlongSkyFunctions.md) with the students to draw a sky picture.

### Challenges
After the code-along, students can try to complete the [challenges](ChallengesSkyFunctions.md).

### Exit Ticket
The [Functions Worksheet](FunctionsWorksheet.docx) has a final **Exit Ticket** question at the bottom. Make sure students answer that question to the best of their ability before leaving. They are welcome to describe it in their own words, or use the description from the [lesson homepage](StudentDesc.md).
